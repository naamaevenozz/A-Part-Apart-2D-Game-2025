## About the Game  
*A Part Apart* is a 2D psychological puzzle-platformer that explores the fragile and changing relationship between a boy and his shadow. The game is for two players - one living in the light, the other confined in the darkness - to solve puzzles together while dealing with emotional and narrative tension.

As the game develops, the illusion of choice becomes central: the boy turns to the shadow only when it helps him progress, and discards it when it is no longer useful. The shadow is always there - but its patience is not eternal.

A third presence - the voice of the system - guides, mocks and manipulates the two characters, slowly pushing them apart, questioning their trust and turning their relationship into a test of control and consequences.

## Core Mechanics
- **Puzzle Solving**: Understanding who the powerful character is will help advance to the next level.

- **Interaction between Shadow Layers**: The shadow can only move in the dark, and interacts with objects the child cannot reach. The shadow cannot be in places where light is spilling.

- **Emotional Choices**: The player's decisions subtly alter the emotional dynamics between the characters, sometimes in unexpected ways.

- **AI Voice**: A reactive and manipulative narrator challenges the player's sense of agency.

- **Split Gameplay**: At a turning point in the story, the gameplay splits - each character operates in a different part of the world.

- **Betrayal Mechanics (Final Scene)**: The shadow can choose to sabotage the child and vice versa, testing the player's emotional connections and morality.

## Player Mechanics
- `WASD` — Movement (Shadow)
- `Arrow Keys` — Movement (Child)

## Level Design
- Each stage represents a different part of the world that requires a different interaction between the child and their shadow.
- Puzzles combine platform games, light/shadow logic, and timed cooperation.
- Two-layer gameplay - a layer of objects that interact with the shadow and a layer for the child.
- Places that the shadow cannot pass through.
- Gradually deepening visual metaphors: the possibility of harm in order to advance, and more.

## Art Style

- **Minimalist and symbolic**, but emotionally charged.
- **Cold colors** The game uses black, white, and gray colors, there is parallax in the layers of the world, the boy and his shadow are small in comparison.
- **The boy and the shadow** are drawn in contrasting but complementary styles (e.g., line art versus solid shapes).
- Changes in the world art based on the progression of the narrative - cracks, glitches, and distortions signify a psychological rupture.
- There are cut scenes that convey specific messages - the separation of the boy and the shadow, the ending, and the shadow's fateful decision.
---

## Sound Design
- **Heavy winds and movement noises** build an emotional landscape - stress as a silent world.
- **Systemic voice** uses distorted and sly human speech (half mechanical, half whisper).
- **Specific voice cues** reflect shifts in emotional state and shifts in trust.
---

## User Interface
- **Minimal User Interface**: Life bar irrelevant to the continuity of the game - there are many stages that do not depend on the life of any character but on the relationship between the two characters.
- **Menu does not exist**, at the beginning of the game there is a video that explains the separation of the boy and the shadow for some reason.
-**Game Tutorial** - is carried out by the speaker at the beginning of the game.
-**Subtitles throughout the game** - Since the only interface is with the narrator, there are subtitles that ensure understanding.
---

## Game Feel
- Smooth movement of the boy and the shadow, contrary to expectations their movement is not dependent on each other.
- The camera moves depending on the two players and moves from stage to stage only if what needed to be done in it happened.
- There is a Parallax layer that enhances the feeling of movement of the players and their small size in the world.
